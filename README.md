# Boulder Blast
Boulder Blast is a simple grapic based inspired by the Mario Bros. games

In this game, a player must collect all the jewels in each level to advance to the next.
In each level, power-ups such as extra life, extra health, and extra ammo will be provided that must be collected to help get
the jewels. However, be cautious! There are robots out there kill you and boulder and holes that will prevent you from going
where you want to go. Use your resources wisely to destroy robots, collect powerups, and go to where you need to. Are you up 
for the test?
